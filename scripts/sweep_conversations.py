"""100 end-to-end course-recommender conversations against the REAL model.

Not a pytest: every turn costs a live call on the gateway budget, and the
suite must stay offline. Run this after changing routing, the taxonomy, the
bundles or the planner -- it exercises the whole surface at once.

    cd backend && PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python ../scripts/sweep_conversations.py

Covers all fourteen curated roles on BOTH tracks to a finished plan, the six
industries by number and by title through the menu, industries in a student's
own words, every load, change-of-mind mid-conversation, the quarter
walk-through, eight roles nobody curates, ten factual course questions, ten
edge cases, and eight resources-bot questions.

Plans are asserted, not eyeballed: 50 units exactly, no unfilled slot, no
duplicate, no course outside the catalog, and at least half the electives
drawn from courses that role explicitly boosts.

Two traps this has already caught, both worth knowing before adding a check:

* MGTA 495 is a Special Topics SHELL -- four sections (AIPA, GENAI, HC,
  MKTG) sharing one `code` across four `id`s. Plan rows carry ids, so
  validating them against codes reports every Special Topics placement as a
  course that does not exist.
* The degraded reply legitimately contains the English word "None" ("None of
  that needs the model"), so a bare substring test for a leaked Python value
  fires on correct prose.

Exits non-zero on any failure, so it can gate a release.
