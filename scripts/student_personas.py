"""Realistic MSBA student conversations, printed in full for a human to read.

The other two harnesses assert. This one does not: it drives the surface the
way a student actually types -- hedged, run-on, mid-thought -- and prints the
transcripts so somebody can judge whether the answers are any good.

    cd backend && PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python ../scripts/student_personas.py [chars]

Everything it has caught was invisible to the scripted harnesses, because the
scripts used the words the code already knew:

* "whats MGTA 458 about" printed the entire plan of study. "whats" is not
  "what" and "about" was not a factual word, so a question about one course
  was not ruled factual and fell through to the intake.
* "ok moderate load please" was answered with "I want to make sure I answer
  the right question" -- to the question it had just asked. The load reader
  was a whole-message test.
* "i worked in marketing for 3 years and want to move more into data" was
  refused as the career **worked marketing 3 years and move more data**.

Add a persona whenever a real student says something the tests did not.

Second batch (eight more) found seven more: an abbreviated track ("11 mo"),
"hmm actually i think marketing is more my thing" refused as a career, a
role read as its own industry ("aiming for business analyst") dropping the
track and load, stated completions ignored, "why did you pick X" answered
with alternatives, "thanks!" met with the opening, and "how many units to
graduate" asking for the student's track in return.

Third batch (walk-through, swaps, quarter loads): a mid-walk-through swap that
could not be made was indistinguishable from one that had; "can i make fall
lighter" with a plan on file went to the classifier and asked which track;
the goal prompt still promised the removed web lookup; and the load lead
reported the target units while the quarter under it rendered the actual.
