"""A graded evaluation of the MSBA course recommender, component by component.

Different instrument from `sweep_conversations.py`. The sweep drives whole
conversations and answers "did anything break". This scores each PART of the
funnel separately and reports how well, so a regression shows up as a number
moving rather than as a test that happens to fail.

    cd backend && PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python ../scripts/eval_recommender.py
    ... --live     # also grade the routes that need a model call

Offline by default, because the funnel is deterministic almost end to end:
the taxonomy, the menus, role resolution, and every plan are dictionary
lookups and arithmetic. Only classification of an unrecognised sentence needs
the model, and `--live` grades that separately rather than hiding it inside
everything else.

Sections are GATES or SCORES. A gate is a property that must hold absolutely
-- a plan of 49 units is not 98% correct, it is wrong. A score is a quality
measure with a floor, where the number is the useful part and the floor only
catches collapse.
