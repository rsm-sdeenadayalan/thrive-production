MGTF 405 BUSINESS FORECASTING

Fall 2026, Master of Quantitative Finance

PROFESSOR ALLAN TIMMERMANN
EMAIL: atimmermann@ucsd.edu
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Luka Vulicevic | EMAIL: lvulicevic@ucsd.edu

COURSE OBJECTIVES
Forecasts of uncertain future outcomes or events form a key input into most business and investment decisions and
so affect all areas of finance and business practice. Stock pickers and investment analysts need to forecast future
returns on the stocks they consider investing in. Airlines need to forecast fuel prices to determine whether to hedge
their exposure to future oil prices. Companies need to forecast both the expected value and volatility of their future
cash flows to determine whether to use debt or equity in their financing decisions. The Federal Reserve decides
current interest rates based on their predictions of future inflation and economic activity. Home builders need to plan
their construction activities years in advance and so have to predict both house prices and demand for homes before
committing millions of dollars into essentially irreversible investment projects. Pharmaceutical and IT firms are
faced with both technological uncertainty (which products are feasible?) and uncertainties about future market size,
competitors' behavior, and market shares. Predictions of these variables will affect which projects should be
launched immediately, which ones should be canceled, and which ones should be postponed.
This course introduces students to quantitative methods for producing their own state-of-the-art forecasts based on
information from sources such as past values of the variable(s) being predicted, surveys, market information and
other relevant economic data. It also teaches course participants to become critical consumers of forecasts reported
in the media and by professional forecasters. Are such forecasts of much value and, if so, how good is a forecaster's
track record?
The course relies extensively on quantitative methods. Empirical methods such as time-series models, machine
learning, regression analysis, nonlinear estimation and graphical tools lie at the core of the course and will be used
extensively. Reflecting recent developments in the field, the course also introduces prediction markets and large
language models (LLMs) as emerging tools and sources of information for forecasters — both as objects of study in
their own right and as inputs that increasingly compete with, and complement, traditional statistical forecasts.

This book (referred to as ET below) provides a comprehensive coverage of a wide range of quantitative forecasting
topics. The coverage sometimes becomes quite technical and on occasion we will use the book for background
reading. A set of background papers can be downloaded from the web.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
A student who has a disability or special need and requires an accommodation in order to have equal access to the
classroom must register with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). The OSD will determine what
accommodations may be made and provide the necessary documentation to present to the faculty member.
The student must present the OSD letter of certification and OSD accommodation recommendation to the
appropriate faculty member in order to initiate the request for accommodation in classes, examinations, or other
academic program activities. No accommodations can be implemented retroactively.
Please visit the OSD Web site (osd.ucsd.edu) for further information or contact the Office for Students with
Disabilities at (858) 534-4382 or fosorio@ucsd.edu.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. As members of the Rady School, we pledge
ourselves to uphold the highest ethical standards. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor
this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all
academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.
