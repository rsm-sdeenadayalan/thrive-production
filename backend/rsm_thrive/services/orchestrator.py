"""The course surface's one dispatcher.

`router.classify` decides WHAT kind of question this is; this decides what to
do about it and produces the reply. Nothing else routes: the regex that used to
live in `grounded_course_advisor`, the interview state machine in
`planner.next_intake_step`, and the chain of `if` branches in
`bots.answer_electives` are all replaced by the table in `answer` below.

## Free text first

There is no interview. A student who types a real sentence gets an answer to
that sentence, not step 1 of 4 — and the one place a question comes back is the
`unclear` route, plus the single question the situational route asks when it
genuinely does not know which quarter someone is standing in. A form that opens
by asking four questions makes a student answer three they did not need to.

The plan-of-study machinery survives untouched. Swapping a course, walking the
plan a quarter at a time and finalising it are all still here — they were never
the interview, they are what a student does with a plan once one exists, and
they are checked BEFORE the router runs so that "next quarter" and "swap 461
for 463" are not classified as though they were fresh questions.

## The rule this module enforces

**No fact about a course, a unit count, a prerequisite or a deadline is ever
stated unless it came from the catalog, the published skeletons or the
retrieved corpus.**

The model interprets and explains; it never asserts a number. Every handler
below holds that line in the same way: the deterministic layer produces the
facts, the prompt is given those facts and told they are the whole of what it
may say, and where a handler has no grounding it REFUSES rather than answering
from the model's own memory. `grounded_course_advisor` already worked this way;
this makes it the property of the whole surface.
