"""Match what a job or an industry asks for against what this catalog teaches.

One matcher, shared by both web-backed routes. The web says what a field or a
role currently requires; THIS decides which of our courses teach it, and it is
the only thing allowed to name a course. The model never picks one, so it can
never name one that does not exist.

## Why this replaced two matchers

`grounded_course_advisor` and `role_lookup` each grew their own version of the
same job and they disagreed. Measured on identical input (a food-industry
requirement set): one returned four courses, the other six, with different
scores and three courses appearing in only one of them. Healthcare returned
five and two. Two implementations of one decision, neither reproducible from
the other.

Worse, both were doing something structurally wrong for this data. The
catalog's `skills` are natural-language PHRASES — "building and evaluating
forecasting models", "estimating ROI of analytics", 2 to 8 words, 118 of them —
and the web returns short phrases like "demand forecasting" or "experiment
design". Neither matcher compared phrases:

* `advisor._requirement_matches` required every token of the requirement to
  appear somewhere in the course's whole text. So "systems engineering" matched
  MGTA 461 because "systems" is in "recommender systems" and "engineering" is
  in "data engineering" — two unrelated phrases, one spurious match.
* `role_lookup._overlap` accepted a match when every word LONGER THAN THREE
  CHARACTERS was present. "cpg analytics" therefore matched on "analytics"
  alone, and picked up four more courses on that basis.

And both counted every requirement as worth the same. Measured on an aerospace
requirement set, the top result matched on "python, excel, forecasting" — three
words that describe half this catalog. Three of the four results were carried
by "python". That is the "plausible and unhelpful" failure: nothing in the
answer is false, and nothing in it is informative either.

## What this does instead

**1. A requirement matches ONE catalog phrase, not the union of a course's
text.** Words scattered across unrelated phrases are not evidence that a course
teaches the thing.

**2. Words match on a shared stem, not on equality.** "forecasting" /
"forecast", "designing" / "design", "experiments" / "experiment" are the same
requirement, and exact matching missed all three. See `_same_word`.

**3. A requirement every course satisfies is worth nothing.** Each requirement
is weighted by how much of the catalog it separates — the standard inverse
document frequency, over a fixed 31-row catalog, so it is exact rather than
estimated. "python" appears in most courses and scores near zero; "cost
effectiveness analysis" appears in one and dominates. This is the single change
that fixes the aerospace case, and it needs no threshold tuning: a requirement
that cannot discriminate contributes nothing by construction.

**4. Where it matched counts.** A course's `skills` and `tools` are a claim
about what it teaches; a word in its `description` is prose.

**5. Everything is evidence.** Every match records the requirement, the
catalog's own phrase, the field and the tier, so a recommendation can say
"teaches *building and evaluating forecasting models*" rather than assert a
course code and hope.

Deterministic throughout: same requirements in, same ranking out, and every
number here is computed from `courses.json`.
