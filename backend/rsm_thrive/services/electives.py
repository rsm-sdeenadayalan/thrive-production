    Every lookup built on these files is cached -- the catalog is 31 rows read

    nothing. Editing `careers.json` therefore did nothing at all until someone
    restarted the process, and Django's autoreloader only watches `.py` files
    so nothing prompted them to. Found the hard way: two roles were made
    nameable, the change was verified by unit tests, and the running server
    went on failing on the live sweep because it still held the old file.

    The catalog is the source of truth that programme staff edit, so "it takes
    effect when someone remembers to restart" is not a workable contract.

    Modification time in NANOSECONDS, because two edits inside the same second
    are ordinary during a working session and a whole-second clock would miss
    the second one. A missing file reads as 0 rather than raising: the caller
    is about to open it and will produce a better error than this can.

    The stat itself is memoised for `_VERSION_TTL`. Three stats is 10
    microseconds, which reads as free until you notice where this is called
    from: `bundles._by_id` sits inside the combinatorial placement search, so
    "once per catalog lookup" is tens of thousands of times per plan. Measured,
    the unmemoised version took the test suite from 8.7s to 15.1s. A second of
