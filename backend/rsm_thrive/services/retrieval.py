"""Top-k chunk retrieval scoped to a destination.

Hybrid, not purely vector. The vector half finds paraphrases; the keyword half
finds the chunk that literally contains "parking permit" or "$21,279.39".

Why both, measured 2026-08-24 on the real corpus with TritonAI
`api-tgpt-embeddings`: cosine alone put the chunks holding the Rady fee amounts
outside the top FOURTEEN for "what does the MSBA cost per quarter and when is
payment due?", because a chunk of pipe-table rows has almost no lexical overlap
with a natural-language question, while prose chunks that merely mention fees
scored 0.68. The embedding model itself is fine (identical text 0.9999,
unrelated 0.11-0.32); the failure is specific to dense, number-heavy chunks —
exactly the ones carrying deadlines and dollar figures, i.e. the facts a
student acts on.

The blend is deliberately conservative: cosine still dominates ranking, and the
keyword term can only lift a chunk that shares distinctive words with the
question.

Admission is two-tier, and the second tier exists because cosine alone is not
measurable on SHORT questions. Measured 2026-08-24 on the shipped corpus, the
same document scores 0.840 for "How do I set up my UCSD Zoom Pro account?" and
0.531 for "How do i get zoom?" — below the 0.55 gate, so the bot refused a
question its own corpus answers on page one. That 0.55 was calibrated against
the persona probe sets, whose questions are full prose; a student types three
words. Worse, at that length the ordering inverts: for "library hours" the
right page (UC San Diego Library Tours, which contains both words) sits at
0.350 while "About Student Financial Solutions" sits at 0.447. Absolute cosine
is tracking how well-formed the QUESTION is, not whether the chunk answers it.

So a chunk is also admitted when it contains EVERY distinctive term of the
question (`keyword_score >= lexical_min`, i.e. 1.0), whatever its cosine. That
is a much stronger claim than the ranking blend makes: not "shares some words"
but "the question's whole vocabulary is in this passage". It is what rescues
"how do i get zoom", "library hours", "transcript request" and "counseling
services", and it is why the refusal rule survives — "what is the recipe for
lasagna" needs one chunk holding both `recipe` AND `lasagna`, and there is
none. Swept against 13 must-refuse controls (the 3 in faq_golden.json plus 10
off-corpus questions), this tier leaked zero. Replacing it with a cosine floor
plus a PARTIAL keyword match was tried and rejected: it bought no additional
coverage and at 0.40 it leaked 3 of the 13. (That is a different knob from
`lexical_floor`, which does not relax the "every term present" rule — it only
declines to apply it at absurdly low similarity.)

The lexical tier then needed two guards of its own, both added after measuring
100 deliberately unclear questions:

* `lexical_floor`, because "every term present" means little when there is only
  ONE term. "who is the president" was admitted at cosine 0.222 off the word
  "president" appearing in a Fellowships page, and the bot answered from that
  chunk rather than refusing.
* typo tolerance, because the tier demands EXACT term presence, so one
  misspelling closed it completely — "zooom" retrieved nothing about Zoom, not
  for want of the page but because the corpus spells the product correctly.
  Coverage on those 100 questions went from 46/70 to 52/70 with no loss on
  well-formed phrasing.

`min_similarity` still gates the cosine tier exactly as it did, and
KEYWORD_WEIGHT still only affects ranking — sweeping it above 0.25 made
coverage worse, not better.

# against a documented 6/9, refusing five questions the corpus answers. The
# measurement that explains it: "What is the laptop requirement for MSBA?"
# reaches 0.82 term coverage and "How much is MSBA tuition per unit?" 0.71,
# because no single chunk holds EVERY word of a natural-language question. That
# rule was never meant to stand alone; cosine is what caught the rest, and the
# hand-picked probes it passed were short and keyword-shaped.
#
# BM25 is the standard answer: it ranks PARTIAL matches instead of demanding
# all of them, and its IDF term down-weights words that appear everywhere --
# which is also the guard `lexical_floor` provided and that a vector-free mode
# otherwise loses ("president" is common; "immunization" is not).

# Swept 2026-08-29 over the shipped corpus, 14 answerable questions against 10
# off-corpus controls. Relaxing the bar below 1.0 was tried FIRST, on the theory
# that "every distinctive term present" is strict because cosine is there to
# catch what it misses. The measurement says otherwise: 0.70 answered 14/14 but
# leaked 5 of 10, and 0.80 leaked 2 while answering no more than 1.0 does. So
# the strict bar is right with or without vectors, and the only cost is
# "what is the laptop requirement", which no threshold rescued.
# Absolute floor: below this, nothing in the corpus matched meaningfully at all.
#
# Calibrated 2026-08-29 against `faq_golden.json`, and the calibration is the
# finding: BM25 CANNOT separate on-topic from off-topic here. The answerable
# cases score 10.47-18.60 and the must-refuse cases 6.53-11.41, so
# `refuse-do-my-work` (11.41) outranks both `msba-per-unit-tuition` (10.47) and
# `laptop` (10.91). No absolute threshold and no best/second ratio splits them.
# Deciding that "how do I drop a class" is in scope and "do my homework" is not
# is exactly the semantic judgement embeddings make, and this mode has none.
#
# So the floor is set for COVERAGE, and safety is left to the layer that can
# still provide it: the FAQ prompt answers only from retrieved passages, and on
# the three must-refuse controls it correctly replies that the material does not
# cover them rather than inventing an answer. The DETERMINISTIC refusal (no
# chunks, no LLM call) is what is lost -- `eval_bots` counts those three as
# failures for that reason, and it is right to.

# run here, and that exact leak returns: 1 of 10 controls.
#
# Requiring two distinctive terms was tried as a vector-free substitute for it
# and REJECTED on measurement. It does close the leak, but stopwords mean a
# great many real questions carry one distinctive term: "when is orientation" is
# {orientation}, "how do i get my student id" is {student}, and "how do i get
# zooom" is {zooom} -- so it also took typo tolerance out entirely. Coverage
