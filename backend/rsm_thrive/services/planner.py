"""Intake-driven course planner: interview the student, then build a full plan.

## Why this is not the electives bot

`services/electives.py` answers "which electives suit my career goal" in one
turn. It already accepts a rich profile — technical comfort, workload
tolerance, weighted career tags — but `recommend_for` hardcodes comfort 3 and
"moderate" workload, because a single chat turn has nowhere to ask. So the
engine was always able to personalise and never had the data.

This module supplies that data. It asks first (`intake_questions`), maps the
answers onto the profile the scorer already understands (`profile_from_intake`),
and then fills a real plan of study quarter by quarter rather than returning a
flat top-five.

## The plan is a skeleton with holes, not a free-for-all

The quarter structure, the core courses and the unit size of every elective
slot come from Rady's published plans of study (data/corpus/program/). A
student does not get to choose whether MGTA 451 is in their first summer, and
a 2-unit hole cannot be filled with a 4-unit course. Encoding the skeleton
means the planner cannot produce a schedule that would not be approved: the
core sequence is fixed, and each generated plan totals exactly 50 units —
22 core and 28 elective — which `tests/test_planner.py` asserts rather than
trusts.

## Deterministic, like the scorer it sits on

No LLM decides what goes in a slot. Same answers in, same plan out, which is
what makes a swap explainable ("these two courses teach these same skills")
and the whole thing testable. The LLM's job, if it is used at all, is to talk
about a plan this module produced.

      chose a load for. Refused here and explained by the caller, because
      undoing their earlier decision to satisfy a later one is not a thing to
      do silently, and it is not a thing to do at all without asking.
    * ``(None, [])`` -- not possible at any price.

    THE constraint, and the reason a single global light/moderate/heavy does
    not exist: the degree is 50 units and Summer is fixed, so the adjustable
    quarters must always total exactly the same number. Making one quarter
    lighter does not make the degree lighter -- it moves work into another
    quarter. Saying so is the honest version of this question; silently
    producing a 46-unit plan is not, and `quarter_units_problems` would reject
    it anyway.

    `pinned` is the set of quarters the student has actually answered for, and
    it is passed in rather than read off `chosen`: `chosen` is the whole
    distribution this function itself produced last time, so every quarter in
    it looks decided. Keeping the two apart is what makes "you had asked for a
    light Fall" a true statement rather than an artefact of how the numbers are
    stored. See `quarter_loads` on the intake.

    Units move two at a time, because `_resized` cuts a quarter's budget into
    4-unit slots plus a 2-unit remainder -- an odd budget leaves a 1- or 3-unit
    hole that no course in the catalog can fill.

    their floor and the units land later. This lightens each quarter in
