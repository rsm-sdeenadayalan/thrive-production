"""Fixed routes: the design document's per-profile elective bundles.

Two ways to fill 28 elective units, and this module is the first:

* **Fixed** -- take the bundle the design document specifies for a job profile
  (`data/catalog/bundles.json`), as an anchor / differentiator / universal set.
  Every student targeting that profile gets the same plan, which is what makes
  it defensible: "this IS the Product Analyst bundle".
* **Custom** -- `planner.build_plan`'s existing behaviour, where the scoring
  engine fills each slot against this student's skills, workload and interests.

## Why a bundle carries its own slot shape

`TRACK_SKELETONS` declares elective slots with fixed unit sizes -- `[4, 2]` in
Fall, `[4, 4]` in Winter -- and `build_plan` requires an exact unit match. That
shape is an invention: the published plans of study
(`data/corpus/program/`) give a UNIT TOTAL per quarter and never say how it
divides. Measured against the real shapes, 0 of 14 bundles could be placed on
the 17-month track and 6 of 14 on the 11-month, because every bundle's
universal layer is MGTA 402 (2u) + MGTA 460 (2u) and the 17-month track has no
2-unit slot at all.

Rather than rework the slot model for every plan, a fixed route derives its own
slots from the courses it already knows it contains, and hands them to
`build_plan` as an override. The custom route is untouched, so nothing about
today's behaviour changes for a student who does not choose a bundle.

The quarter's published unit budget is still the constraint -- a derived shape
must sum to exactly what `TRACK_SKELETONS` says that quarter carries.
