    Embedding the text alone left table chunks effectively unretrievable.
    Measured 2026-08-24 against the ingested corpus: the rebuilt Rady fee table
    carried the amounts and payment deadlines correctly, but asking "what does
    the MSBA cost per quarter and when is payment due?" ranked those chunks
    outside the top FOURTEEN — a chunk whose text is `| $21,279.39 | ... |`
    shares almost no lexical signal with a question, while the heading that
    describes it ("Registration fees by quarter for ... Rady School of
    Management") was stored as metadata and never embedded at all.

    Prepending the heading is the cheap half of the fix; the keyword blend in
    services/retrieval.py is the other half. Changing this changes every
    stored vector, so re-run ingest_corpus after deploying it.
