The four-step interview is gone (see `services/orchestrator.py`), and with it
the tests that drove it. What is here is the part that was never about the
interview: the planner's own arithmetic and the small deterministic reads the
orchestrator still relies on.

The routing, the plan and everything a student does with one are covered in
