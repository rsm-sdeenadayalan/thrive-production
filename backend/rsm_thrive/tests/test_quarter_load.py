"""Light / moderate / heavy, asked twice and meaning two different things.

The original asked both at once, on a form, before the student had seen a
single course: five sliders distributing fifty units across four quarters. What
replaced it splits the question in two, because it always was two questions:

* **How demanding should the courses be?** Asked once, before the plan. It
  changes which electives get picked (`rank_electives` penalises a course whose
  own workload exceeds the preference) and changes no unit counts at all.
* **How many units should THIS quarter carry?** Asked during the walk-through,
  quarter by quarter, while the student is looking at the four courses the
  answer changes.

The constraint that shapes all of it: the degree is 50 units and Summer is
fixed, so a lighter quarter is a heavier one somewhere else. There is no such
thing as a globally light plan, and the tests below pin that down rather than
letting a 46-unit plan out of the door.
