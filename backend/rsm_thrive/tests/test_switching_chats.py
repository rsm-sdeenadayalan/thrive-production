"""Several conversations at once, and topics changed mid-conversation.

Two different questions that sound like one.

**Switching CHATS.** The rail lists saved conversations and a student clicks
between them. Every piece of planning state is scoped to a `Conversation` —
the intake, the walk-through position, which questions have been asked, the
situational position — and the whole point of that scoping is that opening a
second chat starts a second plan. If any of it leaked, a student would answer
"11 month" in one chat and find it applied to another, or reopen last week's
conversation and be handed this week's plan.

**Switching TOPIC.** Inside one conversation, going from a plan to a course
question to a career change to a quarter and back. Each of those routes writes
something; none may corrupt what another wrote.

`CoursePlan` is the deliberate exception and it is tested here too: it is keyed
to the USER, is what `GET /plan` serves, and outlives the chat that built it.
