"""Long conversations, taken in orders nobody wrote a test for.

The hand-written tests each walk one path. A student does not: they answer half
a question, ask about a course, change career, walk two quarters, go back, swap
something, change their mind about the load, and say "thanks" in the middle. The
bugs that survive a test suite live in those orderings.

So this drives conversations from a fixed vocabulary in a SEEDED random order
and checks the invariants after every single turn. Seeded, not random: a sweep
that fails on an unrecorded seed is a bug report nobody can reproduce. The seeds
are listed, so a failure names the exact conversation that produced it and it
replays identically.

The invariants are the ones a student would notice being broken:

* a reply is never empty, and never the degraded "I can't reach my sources";
* a plan, whenever one exists, is still 50 units with no course twice and no
  unfillable hole;
* the session's own state stays describable -- the walk-through index points at
  a real quarter, the intake holds only legal values;
* nothing a student types can produce a plan for a career they did not name.
