"""Two gaps closed: listing the careers, and measuring the plan we shipped.

The coverage half is the subtler one. A recommendation quotes a figure computed
over the six courses it recommends; the PLAN is not those six courses, because
quarters have unit floors and ceilings and a course that does not fit is
dropped. So a student could be told "32% of what that career asks for" about a
set they were never shown.
