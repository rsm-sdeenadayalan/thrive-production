"""The course recommender's front door: a field, or the industry menu.

A student arrives on this surface in one of two states, and the flow exists to
serve both:

* **They know what they want.** Name a role the mapping covers and they get
  its curated elective bundle, as before.
* **They do not.** "I don't know" is the commonest opening on an advising
  surface and the least useful thing to route as UNCLEAR. It now opens the
  industry menu: six industries, then that industry's ranked job titles, then
  the bundle for whichever they pick.

Both halves are curated. The web lookup that used to answer for roles and
industries the catalog had no profile for is GONE -- see
`test_no_profile_stops` below for what replaced it, and `advisor.py`'s
docstring for why. Everything a student is shown here traces to
`data/catalog/industries.json`, which carries Part III section 3.3 of the MSBA
Elective Recommender design document.
