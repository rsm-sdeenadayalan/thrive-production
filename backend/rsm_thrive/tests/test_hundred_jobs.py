"""A hundred job titles, and the rules that must hold for every one of them.

Fourteen careers are curated. Students name whatever they like, so the list
below is deliberately unbalanced towards what the app has NOT been built for:
analytics-adjacent jobs it can partly serve, jobs it cannot serve at all,
misspellings, and bare areas that name no job.

Three rules, checked on all hundred:

1. **Nothing is invented.** If the reply names a job, the student said it — or
   it is offered as a reading and asked about, not asserted.
2. **Nothing is recommended without saying it is a recommendation.** A reply
   that lists course codes under a confident heading reads as an instruction
   unless it says otherwise in the same breath.
3. **Nothing crashes, and every plan that appears is legal.**
