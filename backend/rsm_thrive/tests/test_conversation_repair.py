Every case here came out of one real session, and each was a different kind of

1. **"17 month data nalyst"** — the track was read, the career was not, and the
   student was asked for the career they had just given.
2. **The plan said what it had assumed about Python** rather than ever asking.
3. **"what about a consultant"** rebuilt the plan and looked identical: same
