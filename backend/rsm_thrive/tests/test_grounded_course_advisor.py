"""What survived the removal of the web-backed industry recommender.

This module used to test a two-stage recommender: a web lookup for what a
field hires for, then a catalog match. Both stages are gone -- the industry
answer now comes from the curated taxonomy in `data/catalog/industries.json`
(see `test_industry_flow.py`), and the catalog matching is `skill_match`'s,
tested in `test_skill_match.py`.

What is left in `advisor.py` is the half that never touched the web: reading a
field out of a student's sentence, which `router` still depends on to decide
whether a question is industry-shaped. Those are the tests kept here.
