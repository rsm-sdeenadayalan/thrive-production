"""A hundred plans, checked for the invariants that make a plan legal.

Unit tests pin behaviour one case at a time. This sweeps the whole input space
the planner actually sees -- every track against every curated role against
every load answer, plus every single-quarter override on top -- and asserts the
properties that must hold for ALL of them.

Why a sweep rather than more unit tests: the light/moderate/heavy answers move
units between quarters, and the failure they risk is arithmetic. A plan that
totals 48 units, or leaves a 3-unit hole no course can fill, or schedules the
same course twice, is wrong in a way a student would only discover at
graduation -- and it would be wrong for one combination out of ninety while
every hand-written case passed.

The invariants, all of them checked on every plan:

1. **50 units**, 22 core and 28 elective -- the degree requirement.
2. **Every quarter within its published bounds**, and even, because
   `_resized` cuts a budget into 4-unit slots plus a 2-unit remainder.
3. **No course twice**, by catalog id.
4. **Every course real**, offered in the quarter it is placed in, and at the
   unit size of the slot it fills.
5. **No core course displaced** -- the published sequence is not negotiable.
