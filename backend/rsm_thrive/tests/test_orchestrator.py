"""Routing, and what each route actually produces.

The four-step interview is gone. What replaces it is one classifier and one
dispatch table, so these tests are organised the same way: what the router
decides, then what each route does with the decision.

Two properties matter more than the rest and are asserted repeatedly:

* **The curated mapping stays authoritative.** "I want to be a data scientist"
  resolves through `careers.json` without a model call, and the reply is the
  bundle from `bundles.json`. That is the quality floor and it must not become
  probabilistic.
* **Nothing states a fact it cannot ground.** Where a route has no catalog
  match, no retrieval and no ledger, it refuses and names no course.
