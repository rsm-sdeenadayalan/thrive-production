"""The situational route: where a student is, against what the degree requires.

The route that matters most and the one with the sharpest failure mode. If it
says someone needs 14 more units and it is wrong, they miss graduation — so the
tests here are mostly about the line between the arithmetic and the model:

* the arithmetic is done in `planner.build_plan` and `situation.ledger_for`,
  from `courses.json` and the published skeletons, and is asserted exactly;
* the model is handed the finished ledger and never computes anything, which is
  asserted by running the whole route with a model that returns nothing at all
  and checking every number is still there and still right.
