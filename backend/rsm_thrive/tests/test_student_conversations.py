"""What real students type, and what the recommender must do with it.

Every case here came from `scripts/student_personas.py` -- conversations
driven the way a student actually writes, hedged and run-on and mid-thought --
and every one was a failure when first seen. The scripted harnesses had all
passed, because the scripts used the words the code already knew.

Kept as tests rather than as personas because each is a specific promise:
