"""Where else a course could go, said at the moment it matters.

A swap used to speak only about the course coming in. The course going OUT is
the one the student may regret: dropped from the one quarter it runs in, it is
gone; dropped from one of three, it can be picked up later. And a student who
names a course they WANT was answered from the catalog row ("offered in
Winter") rather than from their plan ("your Winter, in place of MGTA 458").
