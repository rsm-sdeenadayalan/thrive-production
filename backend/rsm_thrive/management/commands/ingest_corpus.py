    is 3,385 chunks against the FAQ corpus's 2,421, and it is dense with exactly
    the words a student uses to ask about enrolment: every syllabus says "class",

    off the results entirely; the bot then said it had no steps for booking a
    class while holding the page that has them.

    are one short entry per course and stay in "resources", which is the right
