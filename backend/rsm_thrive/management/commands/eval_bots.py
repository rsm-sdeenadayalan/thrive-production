"""Run the golden cases through the bots; fail on any regression.

Two sources of cases, deliberately kept in separate files:

* `data/evals/faq_golden.json` — hand-written, and honest about what it is: a
  smoke test over the corpus that ships.
* `data/evals/from_feedback.json` — every turn a tester thumbed down, exported
  by `export_golden`. This is the one that grows, and it grows with failures
  nobody on the team predicted.

Pass `--golden` more than once to run both.

## Cases that cannot pass or fail yet

A thumbs-down says an answer was wrong; it does not say what right looks like.
So an exported case arrives `needs_expectation` and is REPORTED, not run — it
appears in the output as SKIP with the tester's note, so the set of cases
waiting on a human is visible every time the eval runs instead of sitting
unread in a file. A skip never fails the command; an unwritten expectation is
work outstanding, not a regression.
